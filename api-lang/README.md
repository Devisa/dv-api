### About
- `(06/17/2021)`: The purpose of this crate is primarily twofold:
    - To contain the majority of natural-language processing related algorithms, datatypes, and procedures for use in outside crates (especially with regards to use in API route requests)
    - To utilize algorithms, procedures, and datatypes from other crates to perform certain recurring and learning-based natural language processing tasks in the background.
