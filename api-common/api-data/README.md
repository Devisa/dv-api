### About
- `(06/17/21)`: Responsible for providing low-level data structures and algorithm implementations and add simple modifications to the extent that they are useful in the crates where they are used. Also defines a number of **low-level** types, that is, types not connected to the Devisa data model but that instead offer some generalized utility, and any corresponding procedural functionality necessary.
