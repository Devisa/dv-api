### About
- `(06/17/21)`: Responsible for providing low-level data structures and algorithm implementations and add simple modifications to the extent that they are useful in the crates where they are used. Also defines a number of **low-level** types, that is, types not connected to the Devisa data model but that instead offer some generalized utility, and any corresponding procedural functionality necessary.
- `(06/17/21)`: In terms of sheer magnitudes, in whatever manner it is measured, this crate's largest duty by magnitude is providing the data model definitions and full database functionality implpementations for the entire API as a whole, generally speaking. Splitting up, modularizing, and increasing the code efficiency of the model implementations provided in this crate has been something considered for some time now -- likely to be implemented in a soon-comng update. Regardless, this crate will still serve as the home for any model behavior or interactions which rise above the non-trivial, in a essential sense.
